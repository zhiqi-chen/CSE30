Each person, at any given time, can keep in mind only a fairly small set of facts; indeed, several studies on software verification point out to the fact that in order to write correct code, programmers usually use no more than a dozen facts about the previous code and input, reflecting what likely is an underlying limitation of our brains.  \n",

It will be easier to change the implementation if the code for computing the stream average is all in the same place, rather than sprinkled in multiple places that must be tracked and updated. \n",

        "\n",
        "If we were in a strongly typed language, such as Java, the answer would be a resounding Yes.  In Java, a superclass serves as the common type of all objects belonging to the more specialized classes.  One can then define a method accepting a superclass, say, an _Averagerator_, and then pass to it objects of any of its subclasses. \n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, objects are rarely tested for the class to which they belong.  The more common pattern in Python is simply the one of calling methods of objects, assuming the methods do the proper thing.  This approach to type checking (or the lack of it) is sometimes called _duck typing:_ [if it quacks like a duck, and it waddles  like a duck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6kizqah-Po), it is a duck --- meaning, if the object's methods do the right thing, that suffices for us. \n",
